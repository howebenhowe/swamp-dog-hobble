# Conflict Protocol Proposal

When the behavior of a member of our community breaches a tenet of our manifesto or crosses a boundary set by someone else and the regular forum of family dinner seems to any member unequal to the challenges of addressing the conflict, we follow this superseding protocol in hopes of recovering our community.

## Incident report, initiating this protocol

As much as we charge ourselves with the custody of our tenets we are obligated to take restorative measures when we fail them. Whoever observes a troubling behavior from a fellow swamp dog that they think would be best addressed by serious and concerted full-community discussion may initiate this process by first writing a note and dropping it off in the 'troubles' box in the library. Afterward, that person should alert the community that there is a new note in the box. Later steps offer more emotionally capable communication; these initiating steps are necessarily constrained.
The note is/includes: 
+ signed by the author
+ hand-written
+ confined in length to the lines of a 3x5 notecard
+ to be read by other swampdogs within 24 hours
+ a brief description of the circumstances and events which will later be discussed
+ an answer to the question "What, in their own words, does the author understand to have happened?"
The note may be/include:
+ photographed in order to send it to distant swampdogs
+ responded to no sooner than the next morning
+ a description of the author's personal experience and feelings
+ request for discretion/privacy within the swampdog community
+ the degree of interrogative conversation about the event the author invites before or during the meeting
The note should not be:
+ typed
+ comprehensive
+ speculative
+ direct address

## Days before the meeting

It is understood that current swampdogs will, with the assent of the note(s) author(s), talk with other swampdogs and trusted friends in good-faith effort to understand the event, share context with one another, and arrive generally better prepared to the full-house meeting. Any dog may supply a note in reply to another, though it should be dropped off and announced no earlier than the next morning in order to encourage time to reflect. Reply notes should follow the same guidelines as an initiating note--that is, they ought offer information and abstain from confrontation.

## The night of the meeting

The conflict meeting displaces the next arriving family dinner--entirely, if necessary. One current member will facilitate the meeting. That person should be a volunteer from those dogs who have not written a note, though every dog may refuse the responsibility. If none volunteers, draw straws. No one should facilitate two in a month. At least once per 50 minutes, the meeting will take a perspective break for ten minutes during which time dogs are encouraged to write and reflect. If we need ten more minutes at the end of a break, we can take it. As the notes will have indicated what nature of meeting the author(s) requested (e.g. "please don't ask me about my past experiences."), the meeting will reflect those requests with deference to the first note. Anyone may recuse themself, and we will support any bid to take a break or slow down that would help a swampdog bear the stresses of the meeting. Notably however, if an author doesn't want to participate, the community may still proceed with a meeting in service of reckoning with the note and recovering the community's equilibrium, accepting that a subsequent meeting may be necessary. While we can offer one another the advantage of our interpretations or phrasing, each swamp dog must represent themself. With exception made for anyone who requests to sit elsewhere, we find randomized seating in a circle in the library/on the porch/around the fire in the back so that body language and expression might be totally apparent.

Within a mode of conversation consented to by each note's author, the facilitator will invite them to speak in the order in which they submitted notes. The meeting moves through three phases, each with their own objective.

The first objective is that we establish good faith receipt by every member of each party's version of events.

The second objective is that we establish good faith receipt by every member of each party's relevant context.
This may include exploration of:
+ what established boundaries/house tenets were transgressed
+ personal history
+ social context
+ power dynamics

The third objective is that we establish new future protocol to which we will hold one another accountable and which adequately correct troubling behavior. 

We only move to the next stage when all swamp dogs consent to on the basis of the current objective having been adequately served. If we should be unable to meet the third objective in within the time constraints of the meeting, the facilitator will present a menu of recourse options, to be established, which might include things like:
+ take a 72 hour recess
+ use house funds to hire a professional mediator for a later conversation
+ two or more swamp dogs take a walk and talk together

Recognizing that sustained crisis is untenable, if we cannot exit crisis toward a new protocol of in-home conduct within two weeks from the first conflict meeting, we must determine which member(s) should leave the house and make arrangements to facilitate that departure. As a last resort, the community will take a vote on who should leave. The logistics will certainly be particular to the circumstances, but we will assure that the departing parties have a minimum of two weeks to find a place to stay, should that look like a new permanent home or a sublet. Irrespective of personal discontents, at least two remaining members will coordinate and offer their labor to help departing parties move out. This outcome represents a failure on the part of the community insofar as kicking anyone out by vote is a base contradiction of our practices. We will follow this failure with a close examination of how we arrived to that position over the following family dinners.

## Emergency sanctuary

If any member should feel abruptly physically or socially unsafe to a degree that the measured approach above is too slow or insufficient to ensure their safety, they may rent an AirBnB at shared expense to the community with no questions asked. It is incumbent upon that member to write an incident report, no matter how scant, to equip the community with initiation of the conflict process above. Adaptations may be necessary in on an ad-hoc basis (e.g. different location for house meeting, insistence on presence of a third-party mediator for any meeting) in order to facilitate the assumption of the standard conflict address process.

## TODO:
+ what kind of note template/prompts would encourage the most helpful information be shared?
+ how can we encourage the healthiest satellite conversations? How can we invite a charitable/generous attitude in them?
+ like no-fault NYS collision policy, what kind of security can we offer both members involved in some kind of conflict, rather than supposing a punitive disposition toward one member? Especially supposing we, at the time, recognize punitive measures as ill suited toward the primary goal of safety and healing?
	+ emergency contact: each member strikes accord with one or more other members on an individual basis like: "hey, when I use these words to ask your audience, I need to know that you will make yourself available just about immediately."
+ what would a prefigured and shared set of safe-words/injunctions consist of+ (e.g. hands up and the words: "Hey, we're de-escalating now.")
