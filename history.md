# History

In April 2021, Ben picked up the phone and rung a few folks. The proposal: this atomized life that NYC and much of the rest expects of us ain't the ticket. Howsabout we try a communal home? And so in the summer of 2021, Zachary, Jordan, Davy, Jamie, and Ben headed to Crown Heights and piled into a 5-bedroom place with a lovely back yard. We took our name from plant label in the native plant section of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden: Swamp Doghobble. We made some big batches of sauerkraut, got used to our weekly cadence family dinner, and gradually accumulated the stuff of a music studio in our basement. We grew into that space for a year, appointing it more and more to our tastes and ambitions until, in the spring of 2022, we realized we wanted to grow still more--we were too big for our britches. Zachary's compass swung to Wisconsin for family and a rich future (stay true, Zachary!) while Aleah and Ashley joined SDH. We found a new home in Flatbush and moved one fine week in July. Since then, we've been adding color to the walls and expanding our internal projects (shows in the basement!) and external efforts (the [Tompkins Distro!][tompkins-distro]). Summer 2024 is shaping up to be a chapter fit to burst with fresh activity.
