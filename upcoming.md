## Incidental

### Davy's Album Release Party

What a night! Aleah on drums, Allanah on backup vocals and tambourine, Davy on guitar and plaintive soul-bearing. Back at Dean Street, of course. One of the neighbors told us to be quiet. It was ~7. Fuck them and rock it, Davy.

### Halloween

Do we talk about Halloween party?

### Bilderberger

Semi-anual summit diplomacy convention. The chance we have to ensure a future for the next generation...

## Recurring

### Family Dinner

For current members of the Swamp Dog Hobble community to share a meal, check in on eacch other's lives, develop ongoing ambitions, address conflict, and attend to house necessities.

### Fried Chicken Sunday

Semi-consistent Sunday night dinner, beginning ~6:30. Friends and frineds-of-friends are welcome, though an accounting of guests the day before makes preparing the food manageable!
Dinner includes:

+ fried chinken
+ cornbread
+ tangy spicy cole slaw
+ BYOB

### Movie Night

During chilly months and sometimes warm ones, semi-regular screenings of movies [the stranger the better, but also good movies sometimes]. Highlights so far:

+ The Greasy Strangler
+ a bunch of Adventure Time
+ The Wild Boys
+ Wild Indian
+ Dr. Who
