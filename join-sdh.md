# Join Swampdog!

Friends of Swampdog, friends-of-friends of Swampdog: we're looking for new membership.


This communal living project migrated to Flatbush early summer 2023 after a magnificent incubation year in Crown Heights. In the two and a half years since we began, we have fed thousands of the city's hungry, hosted a dozen house shows in our basement, and screened the Greasy Strangler a couple times. We have navigated the petty interpersonal road-bumps of hair snarls in the shower drain and crusty neglected dishes, and the more serious discontents about distribution of house expenses and resolving what "enough participation" means for an evolving community. The author of this note is confident that every person who has lived here (and many of its intermittent visitors, too) has found their life richer for the joyful and challenging experiences that attend living in community.


Our Flatbush lease expires at the end of November, and membership has rotated such that none of the current lease holders will remain in the house come December 1st. So! We're seeking new membership, specifically 2-3 new members who are interested in signing onto a new lease. If this piques your curiosity, or you think a friend would be interested, please reach out! Our clock ticks, though, and we'll need to have future membership resolved by November 1st. 


Email us at swampdog@fastmail.com or pass along that email (and this message) to a pal. We would love to hear from you.

Warmly,

SDH
