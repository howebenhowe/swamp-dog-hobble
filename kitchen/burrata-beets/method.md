1. place beets on baking sheet
1. roast in oven at 400 for 45+ minutes, until a fork inserts easily
1. remove beets, cool a few minutes until they can be handled
1. peel beets with pairing knife or vegetable peeler
1. cut beets at random angles into asymmetrical wedges, approximately equal bite-size pieces
1. while still warm, toss with balsamic vinegar first, then olive oil and black pepper
1. plate with burrata or pipe in ricotta cheese medallions 

**notes**
+ tossing with vinegar first while the beets are still warm will help them absorb vinegar before a coating of oil seals them
+ if preferred, substitute ricotta cheese instead of burrata. In than case, whip ricotta with black pepper and salt to taste, then pipe it into crevices between the beet wedges when plating.
