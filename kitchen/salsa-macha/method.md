1. heat oil in pot over medium heat
1. add garlic and nuts, cook to gently confit stirring occaisionally, ~10 min
1. add chiles and sesame and stir until toasty aroma (1-2 min)
1. let cool for 20 minutes then add rest of ingredients (salt, vinegar, herbs)
1. in batches, pulse in food processor until nuts/chiles are in very small pieces

**notes**
+ often while the macha lasts in the fridge the ratio of oil diminishes--feel free to add oil a week later and stir it in--the flavors will meld again after a day or two
+ optionally, add a little brown sugar, particularly if the chiles are tart
