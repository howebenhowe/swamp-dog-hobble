## Finances
### GoFundMe
At the start of 2024, we launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise money to cover food costs and acquire a few pieces of cooking equipment. [Contribute to the GoFundMe campaign!](https://www.gofundme.com/create/fundraiser/help-swamp-dog-hobble-feed-nyc-migrants)

### Dinners and Shows
When we host shows in our basement, fancy dinners at our table, or fried chicken in the back yard, we literally and figuratively pass a hat to raise money for the distro. Cash donations are welcome of course, but there is also a dedicated Venmo account. [Donate to the distro fund with Venmo (@swampdog-distro).](https://account.venmo.com/u/swampdog-distro)
