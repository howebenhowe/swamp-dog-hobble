# Distro Handbook

The Swamp Dog Hobble community cooks tasty food for the city’s unhoused migrant population. This handbook documents (or is on its way to documenting) our recipes, fundraising, previous distro efforts, methods, and logistical protocols. We would also welcome your participation.

## a short history

Since late winter 2024, we've been working with [Tompkins Distro][tomkins-distro-instagram], a mutual-aid group which provides food and basic goods to the city’s asylum seekers. Two of us (Ben and Caleb) used to cook professionally; with our housemates’ support and the efforts of the broader Swamp Dog community, we’ve scaled up to 18 gallons of delicious coconut chicken curry every Friday (imagine: four brimming food grade 5-gallon buckets), along with 20 quarts of rice. That translates to about 200 bowls of hot food, every two weeks, for people who would very much like to eat.
