## Help Us Feed People!
When we host shows in our basement, fancy dinners at our table, or fried chicken in the back yard, we literally and figuratively pass a hat to raise money for the distro. Cash donations are welcome of course, but there is also a dedicated Venmo account. [Donate to the distro fund with Venmo (@swampdog-distro).][venmo]

## GoFundMe
At the start of 2024, we launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise money to cover food costs and acquire a few pieces of cooking equipment. [Contribute to the GoFundMe campaign!][gofundme]
