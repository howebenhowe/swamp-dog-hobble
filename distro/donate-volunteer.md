# Donate/Volunteer

## Finances
You can [track our accounting of distro][distro-accounting] to see how the money we receive becomes food we serve.

## Volunteer
At the moment, we're awash in volunteer effort. Come early fall, that won't be the case. As the weather cools off, we anticipate a bump up in the city's appetite, perhaps doubling the amount of food we need to cook and transport. If you want to lend hands then, please [shoot us an email][swampdog-email] to let us know, and we'll reach out when the busy season returns.

<!--If you have hands we could use 'em. Sourcing ingredients, spreading word about the effort, cooking, cleaning, transporting food takes doing â€” [sign up to help us out!][signup-form] if you want to help get more good food to hungry people.-->

<!--If you have feedback or something to ask, [write us an email][swampdog-email].-->


## GoFundMe
At the start of 2024, we launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise money to cover food costs and acquire a few pieces of cooking equipment. [Contribute to the GoFundMe campaign!][gofundme]

## Fund the food!
When we host shows in our basement, fancy dinners at our table, or fried chicken in the back yard, we literally and figuratively pass a hat to raise money for the distro. Cash donations are welcome of course, but there is also a dedicated Venmo account. [Donate to the distro fund with Venmo (@swampdog-distro).][venmo]
