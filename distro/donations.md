# Finances
You can [track our accounting of distro](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FN2MsiddUhml-wRD7RpK3K_PgpTI-jSUwXjg3bW4pOY/edit?usp=sharing) to see how the money we receive becomes food we serve.

## GoFundMe
At the start of 2024, we launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise money to cover food costs and acquire a few pieces of cooking equipment. [Contribute to the GoFundMe campaign!](https://www.gofundme.com/create/fundraiser/help-swamp-dog-hobble-feed-nyc-migrants)

## Dinners and Shows
When we host shows in our basement, fancy dinners at our table, or fried chicken in the back yard, we literally and figuratively pass a hat to raise money for the distro. Cash donations are welcome of course, but there is also a dedicated Venmo account. [Donate to the distro fund with Venmo (@swampdog-distro).](https://account.venmo.com/u/swampdog-distro)
