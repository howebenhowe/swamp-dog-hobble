## Timeline
### Friday
1. Roast chicken
1. Marinade cabbage
1. Peel and crisp chicken skin
1. Cook rice
1. Vegetable Prep (this is also the order in which you should do things)
	1. Onions: sliced or large dice. Your call. Don’t have to be pretty. They’ll dissolve in the stew, basically. 
	1. Garlic and ginger: food processor, pulsed. Peel and rough chop ginger. The pieces should be about the size of garlic cloves. Throw everything in the food processor, pulse it until things look minced. 
	1. Potatoes: these should already have been done yesterday. Place them on the counter before you, as you would a god. 
	1. Canned tomatoes: open the cans. 
	1. Cauliflower: florets, bite-sized, along the lines of the potato.
	1. Peppers (bell and sweet): medium dice on the bell peppers, half-inch rings for the sweet peppers.
	1. Cabbage: you did this a few hours ago. 
1. Make stew
1. Cool stew
1. Add salsa verde
1. Pack stew
1. Pack rice
1. Confirm pickup time/person with Mina
